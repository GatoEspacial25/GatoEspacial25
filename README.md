# Hi there, I'm Carlos 👋

I'm a **Systems Engineering student** from Tamaulipas, Mexico 🇲🇽, with a strong interest in **backend development** and problem-solving through code.

I enjoy building systems that make sense — structured, logical, and useful. I'm especially motivated by projects that simulate real-world scenarios, where code becomes a tool to solve actual problems.

## 🚧 Currently Working On

I'm currently focused on strengthening my backend foundations and building projects that simulate real-world systems.

In the coming weeks, I’ll be developing:
- A **Java + SQL backend application** focused on inventory and sales logic
- Small **Python scripts** for automation and data handling

These projects will be added to my GitHub as they reach a stable and presentable state.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning Right Now

-  Strengthening my foundations in **Data Structures & Algorithms**
-  Learning **Spring Boot** to move from desktop applications to backend web development
-  Exploring **Docker** to containerize and deploy applications more efficiently
